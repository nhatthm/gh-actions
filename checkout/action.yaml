      The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that
      triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that
      event.  Otherwise, uses the default branch.
  token:
    description: >
      Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
      with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
      commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.


      We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
      Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.
